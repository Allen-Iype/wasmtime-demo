This is a demo project for learning the working of wasmtime-go and implementing and testing how wasm works. The Rust codes in this project implement various logics which are compiled into wasm and is used inside the Go test cases using wasmtime-go. The rust code is compiled to wasm using "cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown"
Refactored the project such that the go-code for each contract have been moved to the corresponding Rust-project folders. This is done for the easy testing of individual contracts being added and also for easy reference. To run the corresponding go code copy it to the wasmtime-demo project directory and rename the function name and file-name to main. Then executing "go run main.go" would do the trick.

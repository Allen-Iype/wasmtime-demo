Refactored the project such that the go-code for each contract have been moved to the corresponding Rust-project folders. This is done for the easy testing of individual contracts being added and also for easy reference. To run the corresponding go code copy it to the wasmtime-demo peoject directory and rename the function name and file-name to main. Then executing "go run main.go" would do the trick.
